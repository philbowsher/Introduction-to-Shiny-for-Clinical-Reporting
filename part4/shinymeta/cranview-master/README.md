CRAN Package Downloads explorer
------------------

This app is a modified version of David Robinson's [cranview app](http://varianceexplained.org/r/cran-view) that adds the ability to download a report with source code for re-generating the chart. As a result, this downloaded report can be re-compiled in the future to get at new data for the chosen packages.
